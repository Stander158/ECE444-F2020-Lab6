## Pros and Cons of TDD

Test Driven Development is a methodology where developers write tests before completing these tests with code. There are several pros and cons to this way of programming.

# Pros:

TDD forces the code to be modular in order to make it easy to test, and thus maked the code easier to maintain.

TDD also makes collaboration in development easier, since unit tests can tell the developer if they are on the right track.

Writing Unit Tests before making code is also a good form of documentation and guideline for the code. It also clarifys clearly the input and output of individual modules.

TDD makes it harder to make small mistakes as it would be easily caught with the tests.

# Cons:

TDD is difficult to apply to existing code base.

The test becomes part of the suite that developers have to maintain constantly.

TDD forces the entire development team to follow the same methodology, and forces everyone to have their tests written correctly at all times for it to function correctly.

Test Driven Development also has a learning curve that might be difficult to get into for developers.
